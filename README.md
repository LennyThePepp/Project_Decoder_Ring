A webpage constaining 3 distinct encoding/decoding ciphers 

One is the caesar cipher that when given a string and integer it encodes that string by shifting each character in the alphabet by the given integer

The second is the polybius square which views the alphabet in a figuarative 5 x 5 square of sub-squares where each letter represents the 2 numbers assigned to that particular sub-square
